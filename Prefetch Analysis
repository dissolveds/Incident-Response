## Prefetch Files

When a user launches an application from a particular location for the very first time, 
Windows creates a Prefetch file (.pf) for that application under **%SystemRoot%\Prefetch** (C:\Windows\Prefetch).
These files are then used by the OS to pre-load the stored information from disk into memory in advance to speed up subsequent boots or application startup. 


## Forensic Value of Prefetch Files

 Prefetch files contain the following information:
 
 - The name of executable
 - The executableâ€™s path
 - Unicode list of DLLs used by that executable
 - The number of times the executable has been run
 - The creation timestamp of .pf file (in some cases, this may indicate the first run time of an executable in a system)
 - The last run time of the executable (last modification timestamp of .pf file)
 - For Windows 8 onwards, the 7 previous last run timestamps if executed more than once
 - The files and directories that were used by the executable
